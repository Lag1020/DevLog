# Lost Soul (Temporary)
A dev log for a project I am working on!

In this game, you play as a child who has been stranded in a forest, inhabited by ghost and ghouls!
As the child, you can explore to learn more about the forest, how you ended up in it, and how to escape it.
Avoid the hostile monsters, while talking to the friendly creatures!
